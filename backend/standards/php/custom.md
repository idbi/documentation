# Custom Coding Standard

This page will define what the standards under this page DOES NOT give any recommendation.

### 4.2. Properties

>This guide intentionally avoids any recommendation regarding the use of
>`$StudlyCaps`, `$camelCase`, or `$under_score` property names.
>
>Whatever naming convention is used SHOULD be applied consistently within a
reasonable scope. That scope may be vendor-level, package-level, class-level,
or method-level.

Here we will use `$camelCase` when declaring and using properties.
