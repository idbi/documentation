# Standards rules we have to follow.

## [PSR-12](psr-12.md)

As described on:  

>  [PSR-12 Code Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)

This specification extends, expands and replaces PSR-2, the coding style guide and requires adherence to PSR-1, the basic coding standard.

Like PSR-2, the intent of this specification is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code from different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and expectations about how to format PHP code. This PSR seeks to provide a set way that coding style tools can implement, projects can declare adherence to and developers can easily relate to between different projects. When various authors collaborate across multiple projects, it helps to have one set of guidelines to be used among all those projects. Thus, the benefit of this guide is not in the rules themselves but the sharing of those rules.

PSR-2 was accepted in 2012 and since then a number of changes have been made to PHP which has implications for coding style guidelines. Whilst PSR-2 is very comprehensive of PHP functionality that existed at the time of writing, new functionality is very open to interpretation. This PSR, therefore, seeks to clarify the content of PSR-2 in a more modern context with new functionality available, and make the errata to PSR-2 binding.
